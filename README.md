# String_matching_algorithms_project


Input description : String matching is fundamental to database and text processing applica- tions. Every text editor must contain a mechanism to search the current document for arbitrary strings. A text string T of length n. A pattern string P of length m. The input file can be downloaded from the following URL https://goo.gl/xNZFHt
Problem description : Develop ’C’ code for Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore and Two- Way string matching algorithms to address the following problems:
• Count the occurrence of the pattern ’dagdag’. The algorithm should skip the pattern (’dagdag’) matching between the patterns ’defca’ and ’gadda’.
• Find the number of occurrences if the length (number of characters) between the strings ’abcd’ and ’dagdag’ is less than 2000. If the length ¡2000, skip the pattern (’dagdag’) matching.
• Write the complexities (space and time) and CPU timings for all algorithms.
